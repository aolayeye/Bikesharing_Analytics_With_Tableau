## Summary
The analysis of the New York bike sharing data provided the follwoing insights:

- 81.09% of bike riders are annual customers
- the ratio of male bike riders to female bike riders is 3:1
- Thursdays between 5pm and 8pm is the peak period for the month of August

##### Additional Analysis
1. To provide further insight, we may perform the same set of analyses for multiple months of the year.
  -This type of analysis can help determine any pattern or trend to the demand for bike-sharing services for the year.
2. Another visualization we may perform is determining how many start stations are also end stations for the same trip.
  -Knowing that a bike trip started and ended in the same location can help illuminate questions around the number of stations required for a specified geographic area.
